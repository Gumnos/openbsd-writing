# OpenBSD for Writers

by [Matthew Graybosch](https://www.matthewgraybosch.com)

## About

This is the source text for a series of blog posts (and possibly a book) on how writers can use OpenBSD to set up dedicated computers (or virtual machines) to compose both fiction and non-fiction prose, poetry, technical writing, and even screenplays using free software on an operating system descended from the original Unix via BSD while enjoying a reasonable level of confidence that their computer will not spy on them or be vulnerable to remote intrusion. It may eventually become a general guide to desktop OpenBSD usage for a wider audience, but my primary focus will be on writing.

## Rationale

I've decided to begin writing this guide for the following reasons.

* If I had dared try OpenBSD sooner, I might have wasted so many years looking for a GNU/Linux distribution that felt *right*.
* I am not aware of any guides to OpenBSD geared toward writers and authors.
* I am not aware of any guides to OpenBSD geared toward desktop users in general.
* I had to learn everything I know by reading documentation written by and for developers and system administrators, and I want to make OpenBSD more accessible to writers who were more sensible than I and didn't choose software development as a day job.

## Topics

The following list of topics is subject to change and expansion.

* Introduction
* Getting OpenBSD and Preparing Installation Media
