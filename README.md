# OpenBSD for Writers

by [Matthew Graybosch](https://www.matthewgraybosch.com)

This is the source text for a series of blog posts (and possibly a book) on how writers can use OpenBSD to set up dedicated computers (or virtual machines) to compose both fiction and non-fiction prose, poetry, technical writing, and even screenplays using free software on an operating system descended from the original Unix via BSD while enjoying a reasonable level of confidence that their computer will not spy on them or be vulnerable to remote intrusion.

It may eventually become a general guide to desktop OpenBSD usage for a wider audience, but my primary focus will be on writing.
